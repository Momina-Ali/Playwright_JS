Step 1: Install Dependencies


text
npm i -D @playwright/test allure-playwright
Install Allure command line globally for report generation and viewing:

text
npm install -g allure-commandline --save-dev





Step 2: Configure Playwright to Use Allure Reporter
Modify your Playwright configuration file (playwright.config.js or .ts) to add allure-playwright as a reporter:

js
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [
    ['line'], // console output
    ['allure-playwright', { resultsDir: 'allure-results' }],
  ],
});


Step 3: Run Playwright Tests with Allure Reporter
Execute your tests normally with Playwright, which will generate allure result files:

text
npx playwright test
The allure-results folder will be populated with result files after test execution.

Step 4: Generate Allure HTML Report
Generate the readable HTML report from the results:

text
allure generate allure-results --clean -o allure-report
This creates an allure-report folder containing the HTML report files.

Step 5: Open Allure Report in Browser
Launch the generated Allure report in a browser for detailed interactive test insights:

text
allure open allure-report
